    <p>I've had a stormy relationship with the automotive industry - love-hate doesn't begin to cover it.</p>
<p>It's not that I'm a car guy - I can barely manage an oil change. But cars these days contain a staggering amount of software. And in spite of what some may say, I am a software guy.</p>
<p>So, like a moth to a flame, I got drawn in. Over the last few years I and my colleagues have been involved in a series of difficult in-vehicle projects requiring a huge amount of <strike>patience</strike> <strike>screaming</strike> <strike>head-desking</strike> deep Linux expertise.</p>
<p>I've made friends, and enemies. I've learned a lot. Much of it unrepeatable in polite company.</p>
<p>I've been involved in some successes. You may have heard of the Baserock GENIVI Baseline, which we've delivered on a  six weekly cadence like clockwork, in spite of at least one organisation's best efforts to blow it out of the water (see what I did there?) before we even started.</p>
<p>And failures - many of those. For example I remember folks laughed at my presentations when I tried to explain in 2012 and 2013 that we are going to need frequent security updates, ongoing throughout the lifetime of the vehicles. Since Snowden and Heartbleed no-one thinks security is funny any more, though, which is progress.</p>
<p>Anyway, it seems I can't escape the hypnotic lure of GENIVI. By <strike>an act of treachery</strike> a twist of fate I'm now leading Tools there. Some will say that I am a Tool myself. I like to imagine me as something powerful, like a drill. Others clearly think I'm just wind and noise, like a leaf blower. Maybe I'm just a spanner in the works.</p>
<p>But I digress. The key point is that I've committed to spend up to 8 hours per week helping to improve the tooling situation for GENIVI. By implication maybe in a small way I can help to improve tooling more widely in the industry. </p>
<p>I can't say I'm excited by software tools. I hate most of them, because in general they suck. And in any case, folks who get excited about tools are missing something fundamental...</p>
<p>We need to make software tooling for cars as boring, predictable and safe as we possibly can.</p>
